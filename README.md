# viza2ascii
This simple script converts Commodore 64 Vizawrite word processing software files to readable ASCII. Works with python version 3. Pardon my python skills.. :-)

The Vizawrite files must be in PRG format that can be exported from, for example, d64 files. The script automatically removes the first two bytes of the PRG file. 

Usage: python viza2ascii.py filename.prg  
Then the script outputs file filename.txt
